# jshint-groups [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ikokostya/jshint-groups.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ikokostya/jshint-groups)

`jshint-groups` is a wrapper for [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) which allows check different files by using different options.

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g jshint-groups
```
Note: `jshint` declares as peer dependency and can be update separately.

## Usage

Find and check all files described in config:

```
$ jshint-groups
```

Check specific files:

```
$ jshint-groups file1.js file2.js
```

`jshint-groups` automatically detects jshint options for each file or ignore it. It can be useful for pre-commit hook.


## Configuration file

Configuration file is a js file (nodejs module). By default it has `.jshint-groups.js` name. Example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    options: {
        undef: true,
        unused: true
    },
    groups: {
        client: {
            options: {
                browser: true
            },
            includes: [
                'client/**/*.js'
            ],
            excludes: [
                'client/vendor/**'
            ]
        },

        server: {
            options: {
                node: true
            },
            includes: [
